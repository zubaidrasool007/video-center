## Getting Started
First clone the GitHub repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zubaidrasool007/video-center.git
```

## Install Packages

cd video-center
```
- Run the command:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
